# 5440 Final
Each Problem has been presented in its own file along with the Julia code and Excel used in each part of the problems. The PDF for each problem serves as the main document with references to the various Excel sheets and Julia files as necessary.

All Julia files should be able to be run in Atom through the include command with the guidelines provided when they are referenced in the PDF to reproduce the graphs in the PDF.

All Python files should be able to be run through PyCharm if other methods don't work.


**Problem 1**

[Problem 1 PDF](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Final/blob/master/5440%20Final/Problem%201/Problem%201%20Main%20File.pdf)

[Problem 1 Phase Plot code](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Final/blob/master/5440%20Final/Problem%201/5440FinalProblem1PartB)

[Supplementary Code From Professor Paszek for Phase Plot](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Final/blob/master/5440%20Final/Problem%201/PhasePlotFromProfPaszekModified)

I believe the only modifications I made to the last file was to change the names of the axes.

**Problem 2**

[Problem 2 PDF](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Final/blob/master/5440%20Final/Problem%202/Problem%202%20Main%20File.pdf)

[Problem 2 Python Code](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Final/blob/master/5440%20Final/Problem%202/Try2Problem2PartC.py)


The Python file should print out the answer to C, and create the plot for D.

**Problem 3**

[Problem 3 PDF](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Final/blob/master/5440%20Final/Problem%203/Problem%203%20Main%20File.pdf)

[Problem 3 Excel File](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Final/blob/master/5440%20Final/Problem%203/Problem%203%20Part%20B.xlsx)


**Problem 4**

[Problem 4 PDF](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Final/blob/master/5440%20Final/Problem%204/Problem%204%20Main%20File.pdf)

[Problem 4 Excel File](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Final/blob/master/5440%20Final/Problem%204/Problem%204.xlsx)



Just in case a PDF of all answers together was preferable:

[ALL Problems PDF](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Final/blob/master/5440%20Final/Extra%20Copy%20of%20all%20PDFs%20combined%20Just%20in%20Case.pdf)
